# Vision

At a high level, the purpose of this library is to take what our talented design team has done
and translate it over into code. This should be 1:1 to what is in our [**design system**](https://www.figma.com/file/YuFZHgGp9QMb5yof3UmKYY/Vroom-Design-Library-2.0?node-id=455%3A0).

From a developerâ€™s point of view, this library should help you
* Give you the **foundation** you need for Vroom and the flexibility to have multiple foundations for
whitelabel partners.
* Give you the **elements** that you need to compose components.
* Help you deliver **components** faster in your specific **application**.
* Confidence that the elements have been tested and are **production ready**.

# Versioning

Following the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. we have three parts: **major.minor.patch**.
The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release.

* **Major** releases contain significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.
* **Minor** releases contain important new features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release.
* **Patch** releases are low risk, contain bug fixes and small new features. No developer assistance is expected during update.
