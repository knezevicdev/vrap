# Documentation

Just some general information about the icons and decisions that were made.

* **Size** - in collaboration with design, the choice was for the sizes to always be the same. It will match the viewbox along with the height and width. The developer is responsible for the spacing the icon needs, like padding or margin.
* **Optional** - fill & stroke. Most SVGs, if not all, will have fill. Some icons will have stroke which you can change. Look at the icon SVG code to determine what each has.
* **States** - states like hover or active can be handled by CSS. You don't need a specific icon.
* **File** - the icons file currently lives in the library for now but in the future it should come from a source.
* **Whitelabel** - any other icons set will need to be determined in the future.
