This SDK is intended to manage data related to how the user is interacting with the site.

That could mean returing user-specific data based on which market they're attributed to, or data based on actions they've taken on the site.

Note, this is not intended to hold sensitive user data.
Nothing relating to the user's account should go here.

This is simply for NON-PII data based on the user's journey.
